# Find an architectural decision

Architectural decision records (ADRs) explain why CUpedia accepted a durable boundary. Each number in this index is unique. Open the record itself for its status, decision, and recorded reasoning or consequences.

## Maintain the index

This index was introduced with a one-time repair of three legacy number collisions. From this baseline onward, assign the next unused number when adding a decision. Add the record and this index in the same change. Preserve the number and content of a committed ADR; record a replacement in a new ADR and mark the older record as superseded.
