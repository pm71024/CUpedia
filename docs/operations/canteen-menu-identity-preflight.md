# Canteen menu identity preflight runbook

Run this preflight against production after the application commit intended for
the #643 deployment is active, all older writers are stopped, and immediately
before approving the #643 contract migration. Run it again if the application
commit changes or any menu writer runs before the migration.

## Compatibility-release boundary

The immediately previous compatible application commit is
`5fcc9ee86c140ebd3696d7afb654df480f7579a4`. It dual-writes authoritative and
shadow identities and remains compatible with migration 0084. The #665
application writes authoritative identity only. Do not deploy #643 while the
previous writer, or any older writer, may still run; first stop those instances
and run the current v3 preflight from the deployed #679 application commit.

## Read-only execution

Use a dedicated, non-superuser role with no write grants. Grant `USAGE` on the
application schema and column-level `SELECT` only for the fields the query
needs:

- menu items: `id`, `canteen_id`, `menu_source_id`, `external_product_id`,
  `external_source`, `external_key`;
- menu sources: `id`, `canteen_id`, `provider`, `external_owner_id`,
  `external_store_id`;
- votes/comments: `menu_item_id` only.

Do not grant access to source `config`/health, sync runs, vote users, comment
users/content, prices, or the Drizzle journal. These relations use RLS in
production, so the execution role must be able to see complete rows (the
deployment DBA may grant `BYPASSRLS` to this otherwise read-only role). The
command rejects an RLS-filtered role instead of accepting a zero-row false
positive.

Inject `DATABASE_URL` through the approved secret manager and set
`PREFLIGHT_APPLICATION_COMMIT` to the deployed commit. Do not put credentials
in command arguments, shell history, logs, or the saved artifact. Disable shell
tracing before secret injection.

```bash
set +x
umask 077
export PREFLIGHT_APPLICATION_COMMIT="<deployed-commit>"
# The secret manager injects DATABASE_URL into this process environment.
node --import tsx scripts/preflight-canteen-menu-identity.ts --format=json \
  > canteen-menu-identity-preflight-v3.json
status=$?
unset DATABASE_URL
test "$status" -eq 0
```

The JSON output is already sanitized. Keep the artifact access-controlled,
verify its `applicationCommit`, `generatedAt`, contract version, and target
issue, then attach it to the #643 deployment decision. The default human form
is suitable for an operator terminal but is not the approval artifact.

For Aigens, a period-scoped authoritative ID is expected migration evidence:
stop and complete the audited identity transition rather than allowing ordinary
sync to reinterpret it. Stop the deployment and open a separately reviewed
repair issue for
`PREFLIGHT_UNSAFE`, any failed check, any merge/UUID-replacement requirement,
or any unsupported/contradictory identity. Also stop for configuration/database
errors, missing complete RLS visibility, unexpected report schema/version, or
an application commit mismatch. Do not repair, merge, rerun sync, or edit the
Drizzle journal from this workflow.
