# Campus Map canonical scene kernel

Issue: #644 introduced the pure kernel as an expand step. #645 subsequently
made its driver the AMap prototype's single owner for history, camera, focus,
and Sheet commands; #646 now attaches the edit-session owner to that same
driver. References below to the old #593 runtime describe the kernel's original
delivery boundary, not the current product wiring.

The scene and catalog names are navigation vocabulary, not a persistence
model. In particular, a `place` scene selects the canonical Place described by
the [Campus Map domain language](./CONTEXT.md); it does not make the scene
catalog the source of map facts.

## Public seams

- `transitionCampusMapSession(session, event, catalog)` is the only product
  transition seam. It is pure and returns the next session plus declarative
  commands.
- `resolveCampusMapScene(session, catalog)` validates the session and derives
  the building, floor, and category context required by a projection.
- The versioned URL codec is the only persistent scene seam. Browser history
  stores only a versioned ownership marker and navigation depth; Back/Forward
  restores the scene from the canonical URL.
- `CampusMapBrowseProjectionStore` owns one stable scene-catalog object and
  exposes only its read-only view to the URL codec, driver, and UI projection.
  A successful refresh replaces that catalog before publishing the matching
  projection snapshot, so readers cannot observe facts and navigation identity
  from different generations.
- `CampusMapSceneDriver.openPublishedPlace(placeId, intentToken)` is the
  publish-only driver handoff. After the caller refreshes and replaces the
  shared catalog, it validates the Place through the same semantic resolver,
  rejects superseded tokens, and replaces the current task history entry with
  the canonical Place. It is not a `RESTORE` event and never adds a task entry
  that Back can reopen.
- `CLOSE_BROWSE_SELECTION` is the driver-level close intent. The driver returns
  an owned selection to its recorded source and projects a directly loaded
  Place or Content scene to its canonical Building/map fallback; UI callers do
  not inspect driver state to choose between dismissal and navigation.
- `scene-semantics.ts` is an internal seam, not a second product API. Its single
  resolver owns session validity, catalog-derived context, restore focus,
  contribution anchors, and the normalized URL session consumed by the kernel
  and codecs.

## Canonical state matrix

| Mode   | Discriminant       | Canonical fields                         | Derived from catalog                             | URL policy                     |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| browse | `map`              | none                                     | none                                             | base URL                       |
| browse | `search-results`   | normalized query, snap                   | none                                             | query + snap                   |
| browse | `category-results` | category ID, snap                        | category validity                                | category + snap                |
| browse | `building`         | building ID, optional chosen floor, snap | floor validity                                   | building + chosen floor + snap |
| browse | `place`            | stable Place ID, snap                    | nullable building/floor, category, camera target | Place ID + snap                |
| browse | `content`          | content ID, snap                         | building, floor, category                        | content + snap only            |
| task   | `create` / `edit`  | contribution anchor or stable Place ID   | anchor / Place identity                          | task + anchor or Place ID      |

The union is mutually exclusive. There are no optional selection fields that
can combine two scenes, and place/content scenes cannot carry duplicated
building, floor, or category fields.

## Event and command matrix

`history`, `camera`, and `focus` are scalar command slots, so a transition
cannot emit more than one command of each kind.

Events outside the listed source scenes, unknown catalog IDs, and invalid
floors are explicitly rejected with no state change and no commands.

Repeating an intent whose canonical identity and payload already match the
current scene is accepted as an idempotent no-op with no commands.

Building and Place cards use `peek`, `half`, and `full` snaps for the mobile
summary, half-height, and near-full sheet (#908). Explicit buttons and the drag
handle dispatch `SET_SNAP` through this driver. Short cards fit their content;
long cards keep the header and map actions outside the scrolling details.
Changing a snap preserves selection, return context, history depth, and zoom.
New Place selections start at `peek`; copied share links also start at `peek`
and contain only the target's canonical fields.

History is projected from an internal navigation class instead of being a
fixed property of an event: `enter` maps to `push`, `refine` to `replace`,
`return` to `back-or-push`, and `restore` and `noop` to no history
command. This is why entering category results from an entity detail is
returnable while switching result filters replaces the current entry. The
driver resolves a direct task's `back-or-push` cancellation to `replace`
because there is no owned Campus Map entry to return to; this prevents Back
from reopening an already closed task.

## Invariants

1. `CampusMapSession` is either one browse scene or one contribution task.
2. A place/content scene stores only its entity ID and sheet policy. A Place
   uses stable `placeId` as its only required identity and persists its chosen
   snap; nullable Building/Floor context,
   category, and camera target are validated and derived from the catalog.
   Content keeps its required Building/Floor relationship and mutable snap.
3. A canonical URL never repeats catalog relationships. Only canonical
   Building, Place, and Content identities can enter a browse scene.
4. URL and history metadata carry an explicit version. Unknown versions,
   malformed or repeated URL fields, conflicting legacy relationship fields,
   and missing catalog entities fall back safely. Invalid history metadata
   resets navigation depth without becoming a second scene source.
5. URL encode/decode is stable after normalization:
   `decode(encode(session)) === normalize(session)`. Place URLs preserve valid
   `peek`, `half`, and `full` snaps in the single semantic URL projection;
   derived containment fields are still omitted. History metadata encode/decode independently
   round-trips navigation depth.
6. `RESTORE` represents popstate/Back/Forward. It emits no history command, so
   restore cannot write another browser-history entry. A direct Place link
   falls back to its Building when that context exists, otherwise to the map.
7. The kernel imports #593 command contracts but never calls browser, DOM, or
   AMap APIs and does not implement overlay gesture, camera execution,
   browser-history, or MarkerCluster failure behavior.
8. #644 itself did not connect the UI. The formal `/campus-map` runtime is
   connected through the #645 driver and projects its browse/edit UI from that
   owner; it does not copy or synchronize legacy session fields or create a
   second session/kernel. `/prototype/campus-map` only redirects to that route.
9. The 7 × 12 scene-by-event-type baseline asserts the exact next session and
   all three command slots for every cell. Payload-sensitive branches such as
   entity `source` and semantic `RESTORE` targets have separate exact contract
   tables; a cell count alone does not claim complete event coverage.
10. Catalog validity, derived building context, restore focus, contribution
    anchors, and URL normalization have one internal semantic resolver.
    The transition and codec modules consume that projection instead of
    re-deriving scene meaning independently. Catalog entity IDs must be own
    properties so untrusted deep-link IDs cannot resolve through the object
    prototype; JSON-shaped entity values are checked for required fields. Every
    catalog, relationship, session, and task-anchor ID is canonical only when it
    is a non-empty string equal to its trimmed value. Non-canonical identities
    are rejected or fall back; codecs never trim them into a different identity.
11. Runtime facts and catalog identity advance as one projection-store
    generation. Components must not copy the catalog or manually synchronize a
    second driver catalog after refresh.
